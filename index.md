# Welcome to my webpage!

I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Lausanne, currently visiting at the Centre for Economic Performance at LSE.

**I am using big data from online job portals and vacancy postings to investigate how recruiters and job seekers find (or don't find) each other** in the labour market. General research interests: labour economics, public economics and applied econometrics. 

### Research 

- Occupational transitions from the perspective of jobseekers and recruiters *(in progress; with D. Kopp, R. Lalive, M. Siegenthaler)*.
