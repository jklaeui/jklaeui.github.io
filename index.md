# Welcome!

I am a PhD student at the Department of Economics at the University of Lausanne. I hold a Master's Degree from the Universiy College London. 

My research interests are in labour economics, applied econometrics and public economics. At the moment, I am investingating how recruiters and job seekers find each other using big data from  Swiss online job portals and vacancy postings.
