# Welcome to my webpage!

I am a PhD student at the Department of Economics at the University of Lausanne. 

At the moment, **I am using big data from online job portals and vacancy postings to investigate how recruiters and job seekers find (or don't find) each other** in the Swiss labour market.

Generally, my research interests lie in labour economics, public economics and applied econometrics. I hold a Master's Degree from the Universiy College London.
