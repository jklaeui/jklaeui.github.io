# Welcome!

I am a PhD student at the Department of Economics at the University of Lausanne. 

At the moment, I am investigating **how recruiters and job seekers find (or don't find) each other using big data from  online job portals and vacancy postings** in the Swiss labour market.

Generally, my research interests lie in labour economics, public economics and applied econometrics. I hold a Master's Degree from the Universiy College London.

### Policy reports & Media

Together with Marius Brülhart, Rafael Lalive, Tobias Lehmann and Michael Siegenthaler, I did some research on how the self-employed in Switzerland are affected by the Covid-19 crisis:
[Report on the second wave (Autumn 2020, German)](https://e4s.center/document/second-wave-swiss-self-employed-dealing-with-the-covid-19-confinement/) | 
[Report on the first wave (Spring 2020, German)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzaWVnZW50aGFsZXJtaWNoYWVsfGd4OjNkOTIxNDdmODBkZGVhMmI)

And there is even a short quote by me about our results in the Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag: [Studie zur zweiten Welle: 200 000 Selbständige fürchten um ihre Existenz](https://nzzas.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/zweite-welle-viele-selbstaendige-fuerchten-um-ihre-existenz-ld.1589295).
