# Welcome!

I am a PhD student at the Department of Economics at the University of Lausanne. At the moment, I am investingating how recruiters and job seekers find (or don't find) each other using big data from  Swiss online job portals and vacancy postings. 

Generally, my research interest lie in labour economics, public economics and applied econometrics. I hold a Master's Degree from the Universiy College London.
