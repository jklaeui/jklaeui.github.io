# Welcome to my webpage!

I am a PhD student at the Department of Economics at the University of Lausanne. 

At the moment, **I am using big data from online job portals and vacancy postings to investigate how recruiters and job seekers find (or don't find) each other** in the Swiss labour market.

Generally, my research interests lie in labour economics, public economics and applied econometrics. I hold a Master's Degree from the Universiy College London. 

### Policy reports & Media

There is a short quote by me in the Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag: [Studie zur zweiten Welle: 200 000 Selbständige fürchten um ihre Existenz](https://nzzas.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/zweite-welle-viele-selbstaendige-fuerchten-um-ihre-existenz-ld.1589295). 

The article discusses two reports I did together with M. Brülhart, R. Lalive, T. Lehmann and M. Siegenthaler on how the self-employed in Switzerland are affected by the Covid-19 crisis. ([Report first wave](https://e4s.center/document/second-wave-swiss-self-employed-dealing-with-the-covid-19-confinement/),  [Report second wave](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzaWVnZW50aGFsZXJtaWNoYWVsfGd4OjNkOTIxNDdmODBkZGVhMmI))

### Other

Together with Pascal Josephy, I founded the web design and web development agency [JKweb](https://jkweb.ch/) in 2011. It still exists and by now employs over 30 programmers, designers and other specialists in Zurich and Basel.
