# Welcome to my webpage!

I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Lausanne.

From September 2022 - March 2023 I will be visiting the Centre for Economic Performance at LSE.

**I am using big data from online job portals and vacancy postings to investigate how recruiters and job seekers find (or don't find) each other** in the labour market.

General research interests: labour economics, public economics and applied econometrics. 

### Policy reports & Media

There is a short quote by me in the Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag: [Studie zur zweiten Welle: 200 000 Selbständige fürchten um ihre Existenz](https://nzzas.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/zweite-welle-viele-selbstaendige-fuerchten-um-ihre-existenz-ld.1589295). 
The article discusses policy work on how the self-employed in Switzerland were affected by the Covid crisis (with M. Brülhart, R. Lalive, T. Lehmann and M. Siegenthaler)

### Other

Together with Pascal Josephy, I founded the web design and web development agency [JKweb](https://jkweb.ch/) in 2011 (at the age of 17). The company by now employs over 30 programmers, designers and other specialists in Zurich and Basel.
